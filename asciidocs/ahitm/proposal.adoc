== Project Proposal
=== Project name
Rocketman

=== Pre-project
There has been build a Rocket for the CanSat Competition that need a mobile launch suitcase.

=== Assignment of tasks
Our assigment of task is that we build and code a suitcase that can start a rocket wireless.


=== Goal
* With the mobile control unit it should be possible on the one hand to ignite model rockets by cable and on the other hand to carry out wireless communication (control and reception of telemetry data) with several branch offices at the same time. Communication should take place in two frequency ranges or with two protocols at the same time (433 MHz LoRa and 802.11b / g / n network using XBee 568).
* It's not a goal to build the rocket just the suitcase.

== Project risks
* communication between team members from different classes
* Some hardware could not work the way we thought
* We're blowing the budget
